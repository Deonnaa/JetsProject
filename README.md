I developed this program as part of my coding journey and to help users discover the world of Jets! I hope it proves helpful to others as they embark on their coding adventures too. If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's learn and code together!

## Description
The Jets Application is a Java program designed for managing and exploring a fleet of jets. Developed as a hands-on project, this application demonstrates core Java programming concepts, including object-oriented programming, user input processing, and file handling.

With the Jets Application, users can interactively manage their fleet of jets, which can include different types of aircraft, such as cargo jets, fighter jets, and passenger jets. This program allows users to perform various operations on their fleet, including adding and removing jets, listing all jets, calculating flight times, identifying the fastest jet, and more.

## How to Use
1. Clone this Git repository to your local machine.
2. Run the program.
3. The program will display a menu with different options:
   - List Fleet: Read in and view the list of jets in the fleet.
   - Fly All Jets: See details of all jets and their flight time.
   - View Fastest Jet: Display information about the fastest jet.
   - View Jet with Longest Range: Display information about the longest range jet.
   - Load All Cargo Jets: Load cargo for cargo jets.
   - Dogfight!: Initiate a dogfight for fighter jets.
   - Add a Jet to Fleet: Add a new jet to the fleet.
   - Remove a Jet from Fleet: Remove a jet from the fleet.
   - Quit: Exit the program.
4. Follow the prompts to perform your desired actions.

## Technologies Used
- The program uses Java's `java.util.Scanner` class for user input.
- Java 1.8
- Eclipse IDE

## Lessons Learned
- Object Creation: Create objects of different jet types based on user input.
- Object Polymorphism: Use polymorphism to call methods specific to each jet type.
- User Input Handling: Utilize `Scanner` to process user input and guide program flow.
- Managing Object References: Understand how references to objects work in Java. Modifying an object through one reference will affect all references to that object in the list.
- Updating Object Properties: If needed, update the properties of objects within the fleet as you add/remove.

## Usage Examples
- 1: Will Read Jets in from File.
- 7: Add a Jet to the Fleet
  - Enter the type of jet (CargoJet, FighterJet, PassengerJet): CargoJet
  - Enter the model of the jet: XYZ CargoMaster
  - Enter the speed in mph: 550
  - Enter the range in miles: 4000
  - Enter the price: 15000000
- 8: Remove a Jet to the Fleet
  - List of Jets in the Fleet:
  - 1: Model: XYZ CargoMaster, Type: CargoJet, Speed: 550.0 mph, Range: 4000 miles, Price: $15,000,000.00
  - 2: Model: Delta Fighter, Type: FighterJet, Speed: 1500.0 mph, Range: 800 miles, Price: $10,000,000.00
  - 3: ....
  - [Pick 2]
  - Jet removed from the fleet:
  - Model: Delta Fighter
  - Type: FighterJet
  - Speed: 1500.0 mph
  - Range: 800 miles
  - Price: $10,000,000.00
